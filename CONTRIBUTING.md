## Contributing
To contribute, fork the project (if you have been added as a collaborator, create a new branch). You should then make your commits and changes there.  
**IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP YOUR BRANCH UPDATED WITH THE LATEST CODE AND COMMITS FROM MASTER**  
After you are done making your changes, you should create a pull request from your branch into the master branch of Legend-of-iPhoenix/editor. Your pull request **must** be reviewed and approved by at least one other person before it can be merged.
